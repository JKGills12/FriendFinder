# FriendFinder

### FriendFinder is a compatibility-based app to find "friends" base off of matching personality answers.

### The user will be asked 10 questions with a rating of 1-5, 1 strongly agree to 5 strongly disagree. This app will then calculate the score of the user with that of the five different "friends" score. The matching score will then display the image and name of the compatible friend.
